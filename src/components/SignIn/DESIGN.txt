You can create an object from passing in a model.

From the sign In Page when the user Enters the Username and Password we should
look in the database for the username and see if the password matches

http://localhost:8000/signin

lets set state for the signin tab so that we can grab the username and the 
password.
{
  GET /signin/:username {
    "desc": "This should "
  }
}
